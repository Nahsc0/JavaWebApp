Sure, here's a sample README.md file for the ScientificCalculator app:

```
# Scientific Calculator

This is a simple scientific calculator application written in Java. It allows users to perform various mathematical operations such as sine, cosine, tangent, square root, exponentiation, and logarithm.

## Features

- Calculate sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) of an angle in radians.
- Calculate the square root (sqrt) of a number.
- Calculate the exponential function (exp) of a number.
- Calculate the natural logarithm (log) of a number.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Run the `ScientificCalculator.java` file.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the operation and number.

## Instructions

- Enter the desired operation when prompted. Supported operations are:
    - sin: Calculate sine of an angle in radians.
    - cos: Calculate cosine of an angle in radians.
    - tan: Calculate tangent of an angle in radians.
    - sqrt: Calculate square root of a number.
    - exp: Calculate exponential function of a number.
    - log: Calculate natural logarithm of a number.
- Enter the number for the operation when prompted.
- The program will display the result of the operation.

## Example

```
Welcome to the Scientific Calculator!
Enter the first number: 2
Enter the operation (sin, cos, tan, sqrt, exp, log): sqrt
Result: 1.4142135623730951
